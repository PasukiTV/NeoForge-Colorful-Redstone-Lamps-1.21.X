Colorful Redstone Lamps expands Minecraft with a full range of vibrant, craftable Redstone Lamps.

Instead of being limited to the default orange glow, you can now create Redstone Lamps in every dye color available in the game. Simply combine a regular Redstone Lamp with the corresponding vanilla dye to craft its colorful variant.

Each lamp behaves exactly like the vanilla Redstone Lamp – it powers on when supplied with Redstone – but now you can match your builds with custom lighting that blends seamlessly with your chosen palette.

✨ Features:

Adds Redstone Lamps in all Minecraft dye colors.

Crafting recipes use the standard lamp + dye combination.

Perfect for builders who want to add personality and atmosphere to their worlds.

Works just like the original lamp: powered by Redstone, with matching on/off states.

Whether you’re decorating modern cities, cozy houses, or fantasy builds, Colorful Redstone Lamps gives you the tools to make your creations shine in style.
